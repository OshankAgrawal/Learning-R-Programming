        "Recursion is when the function calls itself. This forms a loop, where every time the function is called, it calls itself again and again and this technique is known as recursion. Since the loops increase the memory we use the recursion. The recursive function uses the concept of recursion to perform iterative tasks they call themselves, again and again, which acts as a loop. These kinds of functions need a stopping condition so that they can stop looping continuously. Recursive functions call themselves. They break down the problem into smaller components. The function() calls itself within the original function() on each of the smaller components. After this, the results will be put together to solve the original problem.\n",
